def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:

        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Main program to input a number and print its factorial

if __name__ == "__main__":
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = factorial(num)
    print(f"The factorial of {num} is {result}.")
